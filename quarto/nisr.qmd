-   **Life Expectancy**: Projections indicate that life expectancy at birth in Rwanda is **`69.9`** years as of 2024.

The census results are detailed in various thematic reports, such as:

-   **Population Projection**: This report provides insights into future demographic trends based on the 2022 census data.
