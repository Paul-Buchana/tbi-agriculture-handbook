    "text": "In August 2022, the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) conducted the Fifth Rwanda Population and Housing Census (RPHC-5). This comprehensive census aimed to gather updated demographic, social, and economic data to inform policy formulation, decision making and support national development initiatives.\nKey findings from the RPHC-5 include:\n\nPopulation Growth: Rwanda’s population reached 13,246,394, reflecting an annual growth rate of 2.3% between 2012 and 2022.\nLife Expectancy: Projections indicate that life expectancy at birth in Rwanda is 69.9 years as of 2024.\n\nThe census results are detailed in various thematic reports, such as:\n\nPopulation Projection: This report provides insights into future demographic trends based on the 2022 census data.\nEducational Characteristics: This report examines the educational status of the population, highlighting literacy rates and educational attainment levels.\n\nThese findings offer valuable insights into Rwanda’s demographic and socio-economic landscape, serving as a foundation for evidence-based policy decisions and strategic planning.\nWith regard to agriculture, key information can be obtained from the following surveys: seasonal agriculture survey; the comprehensive food and security vulnerability analysis survey and generally, population data.",
